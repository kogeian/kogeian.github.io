            A topic that I find very interesting is astronomy, thanks to the ASTR132 course I am taking at Sac State. Most recently, we learned how 
            <strong>neutron stars</strong> and 
            <strong>black holes</strong> form in the aftermath of a massive star going supernova. 
            Additionally, we have talked about how we know what we know about stars, and a lot of it is simply examining the radiation emitted by stars via 
            <strong>spectroscopy</strong>.
